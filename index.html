      <p>
        A swimsuit is an item of clothing designed to be worn by people engaging
        in a water-based activity or water sports, such as swimming, diving and
        surfing, or sun-orientated activities, such as sun bathing. Different
        types may be worn by men, women, and children. A swimsuit can be
        described by various names, some of which are used only in particular
        locations, including swimwear, bathing suit, swimming costume, bathing
        costume, swimming suit, swimmers, swimming togs, bathers, cossie (short
        for "costume"), or swimming trunks for men, besides others.
